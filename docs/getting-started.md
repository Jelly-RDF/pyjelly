# Getting started

This guide shows how to install pyjelly and prepare your environment for use with RDFLib.

## Installation

Install pyjelly from PyPI:

```
pip install pyjelly
```

This automatically installs the required dependencies, including rdflib for RDF parsing/serialization and protobuf for encoding/decoding Jelly streams.

## Compatibility

Requires **Python 3.9** or newer. Works on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
